Dragon Ball Legends has become one of the most popular mobile fighting games, captivating fans with its exciting battles, strategic gameplay, and deep character roster. Since its release, players have been grinding to collect Chrono Crystals (CC), the premium currency of the game, to perform summons, unlock new characters, and access exciting features. However, farming CC can often feel like a slow process. But don’t worry, 2025 brings new ways to get CC faster and more efficiently. Let’s explore the **best ways to farm CC in Dragon Ball Legends 2025** so you can enhance your summons and become a true Dragon Ball champion!

### 1. **Complete Daily Missions and Challenges**

One of the simplest ways to farm CC in Dragon Ball Legends is by completing **daily missions** and **challenges**. These tasks are easy to complete and give you a decent amount of CC. Whether it's participating in PvP battles, logging in daily, or completing specific character missions, you can steadily accumulate Chrono Crystals over time. 

### 2. **Participate in Events and Campaigns**

Dragon Ball Legends regularly runs special **events and campaigns** that reward players with large amounts of CC. These events often come with specific time limits, so be sure to check the in-game news for updates. Some events also offer bonus rewards like new characters, rare items, or Z Power, but CC is often the most valuable prize.

In 2025, expect more **collaborations** and **seasonal events**, which typically include missions designed to give you extra CC. Be sure to complete all the tasks before the event expires!

### 3. **PvP Mode: Battle for More CC**

For competitive players, the **PvP mode** in Dragon Ball Legends offers an excellent opportunity to earn CC. Each season, you can earn rewards based on your rank, and the higher you rank, the more CC you’ll get. To maximize your CC farming, focus on improving your skills in PvP battles. With the right strategy and team composition, you can climb the ranks and earn substantial rewards in every season.

Additionally, the **PvP season reset** often provides bonus CC for players who have achieved a high rank, even if you just participate without necessarily reaching the top spots. 

### 4. **Story Mode Progression**

While some players focus on the competitive aspects of the game, others can earn CC by progressing through **Story Mode**. As you complete the main story missions, you'll earn CC rewards. Don’t forget to replay old missions or tackle the **Advanced Story Missions** to get extra CC. The more you progress in the game, the higher your chances of earning significant amounts of Chrono Crystals.

The **new story updates** in 2025 also include new rewards, so it’s a good idea to stay on top of the latest updates. Check out any **new chapters** or storylines and complete them for easy CC farming.

### 5. **Participate in Ranked Mode and Daily Boosts**

Dragon Ball Legends often offers **daily boost events**, which provide additional CC when you battle with boosted characters. These daily boosts rotate, so make sure to play during these events to gain extra rewards.

**Ranked mode** also provides frequent opportunities for CC rewards. The higher your rank in Ranked mode, the better the rewards you can earn at the end of each season. These rewards often include CC, sparking characters, Z Power, and other valuable items.

### 6. **Exchange Medals for CC**

Another overlooked method of farming Chrono Crystals in Dragon Ball Legends is through the **Exchange Shop**. Players can trade **medals** or **special event items** for CC. Medals are earned through various in-game activities such as completing events, challenges, or even participating in certain limited-time campaigns.

Keep an eye on the **Exchange Shop**, as it’s updated frequently with new ways to spend your event-specific items and stock up on Chrono Crystals.

### 7. **Free Summon Events**

Who doesn't love free summons? Dragon Ball Legends frequently offers **free summon events**, allowing you to summon characters or Z Power without spending any CC. While these events don’t directly offer CC, they often provide opportunities for you to earn rare items or even extra CC through the special rewards tied to the summons.

Make sure you take advantage of these **free summon events** and consider timing your summons with new **character releases** or special banner updates to increase your chances of pulling valuable units.

### 8. **Daily Login Rewards and Special Bonuses**

Dragon Ball Legends has a rewarding **daily login system** that gives you CC just for logging in. You can often claim small amounts of CC, and sometimes even larger bonuses on certain days or milestones. The game also provides **bonus rewards** when you log in during special campaigns or **anniversary events**.

Don’t skip your daily login, as even a small amount of CC can add up over time.

### 9. **Save CC for the Right Summons**

One of the most effective ways to make the most of your CC is by **strategically saving** it for limited-time or high-value banners. In 2025, there will be several **premium summon banners** featuring powerful characters and legendary units. These banners are often your best shot at unlocking top-tier characters, but they can be expensive in terms of CC.

Consider saving your Chrono Crystals for banners that offer the **best value**, such as those that feature anniversary characters, collaborations, or limited-time fighters. Don’t waste CC on standard summons when there’s a chance to get exclusive characters in the future.

### 10. **Participate in Global and Local Tournaments**

Tournaments and special **competition events** are great ways to gain large amounts of CC. Dragon Ball Legends regularly hosts tournaments for players worldwide, where you can compete for top ranks and earn substantial CC rewards. Check for **local** and **global** tournaments for your chance to earn rewards.

These tournaments usually have multiple tiers, so even if you don’t reach the top rank, you can still earn CC and other prizes.
